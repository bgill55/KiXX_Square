📚 FRAMING TIP: Why Your Rafter Cuts Aren't Fitting Perfectly

Most framers struggle with bird's mouth cuts because:
1. Calculating seat depth is tedious
2. Plumb cuts don't match pitch perfectly
3. Traditional squares require multiple setups

The KiXX Square eliminates guesswork with:
🎯 Pre-etched pitch angles (5/12 to 12/12)
🎯 Graduated V-slots for precise bird's mouth notches
🎯 One-motion marking for plumb, top, and seat cuts

Result? Rafters that fit perfectly, every single time.

### YouTube Video Scripts

**Video 1: "KiXX Square - Complete Feature Overview" (3-5 minutes)**

Script:
```
[0:00-0:15] HOOK
"If you're tired of fumbling with basic speed squares that slow you down on every job, this video is for you. I'm about to show you a tool that's going to change the way you frame forever."

[0:15-0:30] INTRO
"This is the KiXX Square - a patent-pending 7-inch framing square with 5 revolutionary features built into one compact tool. And before you think it's gimmicky, stick around - I'll prove why professional framers are calling this a game-changer."

[0:30-1:00] FEATURE 1: ANCHOR BOLT MARKER
"Let's start with anchor bolts. We've all dealt with uneven slabs where getting perfect bolt placement is a nightmare. The KiXX Square has a patented 3/4-inch curved notch that marks exact positions at 6-inch on-center spacing. Watch this..."
[Demo: Show marking process, snap-line guide usage]
"Perfect alignment, every time. No more crooked plates, no more rework."

[1:00-1:45] FEATURE 2: RAFTER CUTS
"Now here's where it gets really impressive. Rafter cuts - plumb, seat, and bird's mouth - are usually a multi-step headache. Hook the KiXX heel to your top plate, pivot to your roof pitch using these pre-etched angles, and mark everything in one smooth motion."
[Demo: Show actual rafter marking, focus on V-slots]
"These graduated V-slots create precise bird's mouth notches for 2x8 rafters. No calculators, no complicated math, just perfect fits."

[1:45-2:15] FEATURE 3: WALL LAYOUTS
"Wall layouts? Even easier. Diamond-shaped slots at 16 and 24-inch on-center intervals, plus these channels for flip-side transfers. Trimmers, headers, studs - it's all built in."
[Demo: Show stud layout process]
"Straight walls, every time. No second-guessing, no crooked studs."

[2:15-2:45] FEATURE 4: SLIDE SCRIBE
"The slide scribe is one of my favorite features. Set your depth anywhere from 1/4 inch to 5-3/4 inches, insert your pencil, and run it along the edge for perfectly parallel lines. Great for rips, bevels, edge work."
[Demo: Show scribe in action on plywood]
"Clean, straight, professional."

[2:45-3:15] FEATURE 5: ROOF GEOMETRY
"Finally, for you roof framers - the built-in geometry tables handle hip/valley spacing, length adjustments, and diagonal calculations. No more pulling out your phone or carrying reference charts."
[Demo: Point out etched tables, show quick calculation]
"Complex roofs, simplified."

[3:15-3:45] QUALITY & SPECS
"Now let's talk build quality. This isn't some flimsy import. Made in USA from high-strength anodized aluminum with a reinforced 5/8-inch spine. It's weather-resistant, job-site tough, and backed by a lifetime warranty. At 7x7 inches, it fits in your pocket or tool belt."

[3:45-4:15] SOCIAL PROOF
"Don't just take my word for it. Over 100 units were beta-tested by professional framers. Here's what they're saying:
'I can never use a normal square again' - Mike, Garage Builder
'Halves the setup time on roofs' - Raul, Roof Specialist
'Layouts are faster and more accurate' - Jess, Remodel Expert"

[4:15-4:45] CTA
"The KiXX Square is launching NOW at $29.99 for the limited launch edition - only 1,000 units available. That's insane value for a tool that replaces five others and cuts your workflow time by 70%.

**Video 2: "KiXX vs. Traditional Speed Square - HONEST Comparison" (5-7 minutes)**

Script:
```
[Hook]: "I'm going to time myself doing the same framing tasks with a traditional speed square and then with the KiXX Square. No editing tricks. Real-world test. Let's see if the 70% time savings claim is legit."

[Setup]: "I've got a section of wall to layout - 8 studs at 16-inch on-center, a rafter to cut with bird's mouth, and an anchor bolt layout to mark. First, the old way..."

[Traditional Method]: 
- Show struggle with tape measure, pencil, multiple checks
- Time each task, show clock
- Note frustrations: "See how I have to flip this around?" "Now I need my tape measure again..."

[KiXX Method]:
- Show same tasks with KiXX features
- Time each task, show clock
- Note ease: "One motion, done." "No measuring needed."

[Results Comparison]:
- Side-by-side time comparison
- Calculate actual percentage saved
- Discuss accuracy differences

[Verdict]: "The numbers don't lie. Is KiXX perfect for everything? No square is. But for framing-specific tasks, it's significantly faster and more accurate. Worth the $29.99? Absolutely."

**Email 2: Feature Spotlight (Day 3)**

Subject Line: How Mike saved 3 hours on his last foundation job

Body:
```
[First Name],

Mike is a garage builder in Portland. He's been framing for 12 years.

Last month, he had a foundation pour with 47 anchor bolts to mark on the plates.

Using his traditional methods (tape measure, pencil, lots of double-checking), this usually took him 4+ hours for the whole layout.

With the KiXX Square's Anchor Bolt Location Marker, he finished in 1 hour.

Here's what he told us:

"The 3/4-inch curved notch marks perfect positions at 6-inch on-center. The snap-line guide keeps everything straight even on uneven slabs. I literally saved 3 hours of layout time. I can never use a normal square again."

That's $150-300 in saved labor (depending on your rate) on ONE job.

The KiXX Square pays for itself the first time you use it.

**Email 4: Urgency (Day 7)**

Subject Line: 🚨 1,000 units. That's it. Here's why.

Body:
```
[First Name],

You might be wondering: "Why only 1,000 units for launch?"

Fair question. Here's the honest answer:

1. QUALITY CONTROL: We're a small team committed to American manufacturing. We'd rather sell out than compromise on quality with mass overseas production.

2. DEMAND TESTING: This is our first product. We want to make sure every customer gets white-glove service, fast shipping, and quick support.

3. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT: Early adopter feedback helps us refine future batches and develop new products.

But here's what that means for you:

✅ You're getting a LIMITED EDITION tool that won't be widely available
✅ You're supporting American manufacturing and innovation
✅ You're getting in on the ground floor of something special

❌ Once we sell out, there WILL be a waiting list for the next batch

Based on pre-launch interest, we expect to sell 500-700 units in the first week.

That means if you wait, you might miss out.

### FAQ Section (Critical for Conversions)

**Q: How is the KiXX Square different from a traditional speed square?**
A: Traditional speed squares are one-dimensional tools for basic angles. KiXX Square integrates 5 specialized features: anchor bolt markers, rafter guides, wall layout systems, slide scribes, and roof geometry calculators - all precision-engineered into one tool. It's designed specifically for modern framing workflows.

**Q: Is it really 70% faster?**
A: Yes - based on timed beta tests with professional framers. For example, anchor bolt layouts that took 4+ hours with traditional methods took just over 1 hour with KiXX. Rafter cuts that required multiple tool setups and measurements now take one smooth motion. Real-world time savings vary by task and user experience.

**Q: Will this work for [specific application]?**
A: KiXX Square is optimized for residential and light commercial framing, including foundations, wall framing, roof cutting, and deck building. It works with standard lumber dimensions (2x4, 2x6, 2x8, etc.) and common roof pitches (5/12 to 12/12). For specialized applications, contact us: support@kixxsquare.com

**Q: What if I don't like it?**
A: We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If KiXX doesn't revolutionize your workflow, return it for a full refund - no questions asked. We're that confident you'll love it.

**Q: When will it ship?**
A: Launch edition orders ship November 2025. Orders are processed first-come, first-served. You'll receive tracking information within 24-48 hours of your order.

**Q: Why only 1,000 units for launch?**
A: We're a small team committed to American manufacturing and quality control. We'd rather ensure every customer gets a perfect product and excellent service than rush mass production. Based on demand from this launch, we'll scale production for future batches.

**Q: Do you ship internationally?**
A: Currently we ship within the USA. International shipping (starting with Canada) is planned for Q1 2026. Join our email list to be notified when we expand.

**Q: What's included in the free tutorial library?**
A: You get instant access to our complete video training series ($47 value): detailed tutorials on all 5 features, pro tips from beta testers, advanced techniques, and troubleshooting guides. Access is permanent - watch anytime, anywhere.

**Q: Is there a warranty?**
A: Yes - lifetime warranty against manufacturing defects. If your KiXX Square breaks due to defects in materials or workmanship, we'll replace it free. Normal wear and tear, misuse, or modifications void the warranty.

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of KiXX Square - a brand new tool company launching this November.

I've been following your channel for a while ([mention specific video you liked]) and I love how you give honest, no-BS reviews that actually help builders make smart decisions.

I'd like to send you one of our KiXX Squares for an honest review.

WHAT IS IT?
A patent-pending 7" framing square with 5 integrated features:
- Anchor bolt location marker
- Rafter cut guides (plumb, seat, bird's mouth)
- Wall layout system
- Slide scribe (1/4" to 5-3/4")
- Roof geometry calculator

We've beta-tested it with 100+ professional framers and the feedback has been incredible. But I want unbiased opinions from trusted voices like yours.

✓ Free KiXX Square (yours to keep, $29.99 value)
✓ 15% affiliate commission on any sales from your audience
✓ No script - just your honest take (positive or negative)

I'm not looking for a puff piece. If you think it's gimmicky or not worth the money, say so. Honest reviews build trust, and that's what matters.
