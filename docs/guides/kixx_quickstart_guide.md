## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem: Sales Are Slower Than Expected (< 30 units Day 1)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check website - is checkout working?
2. Review ad targeting - too narrow?
3. Test different ad creative - change hook
4. Increase ad budget 50% temporarily
5. Reach out to email list again with urgency
6. Post more frequently on social (3x/day)
7. Consider limited-time discount (10% off for 48 hours)

### Problem: Website Traffic But No Sales

**Check These:**
1. Is price clearly displayed? ($29.99)
2. Is "Add to Cart" button prominent?
3. Are product photos high quality?
4. Is checkout process too complicated? (enable guest checkout)
5. Do you have trust signals? (reviews, guarantees, badges)
6. Is mobile experience smooth? (60% of traffic is mobile)

**Quick Fixes:**
- Add urgency: "Only [X] units left"
- Add guarantee: "30-day money-back guarantee"
- Reduce friction: Guest checkout, fewer form fields
- Add live chat widget for questions

### Problem: Too Many Orders, Can't Keep Up

**Great problem! Solutions:**
1. Temporarily pause ads to slow orders
2. Adjust delivery timeline on website (be honest)
3. Hire temp help for fulfillment
4. Set up auto-responder: "High demand - shipping within 48 hours"
5. Create waitlist for next batch
6. Raise price slightly ($34.99) to manage demand

### Problem: Negative Feedback/Product Issues

**Response Plan:**
1. Respond within 1 hour (publicly acknowledge)
2. Move to private DM/email to resolve
3. Offer immediate refund/replacement
4. Over-deliver on resolution (refund + let them keep it)
